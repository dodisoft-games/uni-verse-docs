2. [The Hierarchy component](./hierarchy.md) is a hierarchical representation of your Scene. 

3. [The Scene component](./scene.md) is the window where you construct your game visually in 3D. 

4. [The Inspector component](./inspector.md) displays the properties of your objects in your scenes. It also lets you modify them to your liking.

3. [The Characters component](./characters.md) has two simple functionalities: upload your characters or create new ones.
